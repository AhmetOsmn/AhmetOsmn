# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ahmet Sezgin!

I'm a software developer specializing in full-stack web application development. I have hands-on experience with **.NET Core**, **React**, **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, **RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, **Keycloak**, **Docker**, and **microservices architecture**. Iâ€™ve been involved in several professional projects where I focused on performance, scalability, and writing clean, maintainable code.

I am continuing to work on microservices and microfrontends.


## ðŸš€ Technologies & Tools

- **Backend:** .NET Core Web API & MVC, Entity Framework Core, Dapper, MassTransit, CAP, Hangfire, Cron, Redis etc.
- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Storybook, TailwindCSS, MUI etc.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MSSQL
- **DevOps & CI/CD:** Docker, Docker Compose, Azure DevOps Pipelines, GitHub Actions
- **Messaging & Queueing:** RabbitMQ, MassTransit, CAP
- **Other:** AutoMapper, JWT Authentication, Keycloak, Localization (JSON & .resx), Identity, SMTP email, Redis (cache), Git etc.

## ðŸ§  Areas of Interest

- Building applications combining React & .NET Core
- Iâ€™ve also been into **vibe coding** â€” blending creativity with code and enjoying the process as much as the result.
